          hicathon org team, Hicathon Working Group 5.4 &amp; the hen.vote dev team.</p>
        <p>This voting DAO is an experiment born from the hicathon, which was the first hackathon 
          organised by and with the community of the Tezos-based marketplace hic et nunc.

        <h2>Why ask the community to vote?</h2>
        <p>Since its inception, hic et nunc received great support from the community so 
          we (the hicathon team) believe that listening to the needs and wishes of the community is key.</p> 
        <p>Good to remember that the hicathon itself was born from the requests of creators 
          and artists active on hic et nunc. The dates of the hicathon were decided through a 
          poll on Twitter and a call for volunteers. The team that was formed managed to set 
          up the hackathon in 1 week and organized a fabulous weekend where 150 participants 
          joined us. The topics of the hackathon working groups were all suggested by the community 
          members and then selected by a vote open to all community members.</p>
        <p>It is to respect and continue this community and collaborative culture that we have 
          produced this voting DAO today. One more time, produced by volunteers, all creators 
          on hic et nunc.</p>

        <h2>Why a voting DAO?</h2>
        <p>Voting is the first step towards the hic et nunc governance DAO. This voting DAO is 
          an experiment aiming to find a voting system for hic et nunc. For now, we will use 
          it solely in the context of the hicathon in order to test it.</p>
        <p>This tool has been developed by Tz Connect (daughter company of the Tezos Foundation) 
          thanks to John Newby (smart contract), and with the help of a fabulous team of 
          volunteers including UFFFD and depatchmode (front-end dev), 
          denscimonk and debasti (UX/UI design), with the support of MZapz and Mitch&Murray 
          from the Hicathon WG. 5.4 “How to make decisions in a decentralized world” 
          (voting framework and feature requirements list) and Diane Drubay (as a project manager).</p>
        <p>Our success will be measured by the community involvement in the voting process, 
          plus the ease to vote.</p>
